<h2>1 Objective:</h2>
<pre><code>        The primary goal of this project is to predict trends in low-income populations (e.g., displaced individuals) in Region 9(California, Arizona, Nevada) and identify optimal relocation strategies using geographical data. The problem involves:
        Modeling spatial and temporal dynamics of low-income groups.
        Incorporating complex relationships between regions (e.g., migration flows, resource availability).

<h2>2 Dataset:</h2>
<pre><code>        There are primarily 3 datasets that we are going to work with:
        1. Health analytics
        2. Unemployment
        3. Poverty
        </code></pre>
<h2>3 Rationale:</h2>
<pre><code>        Utilizing GNNs will help in undertaking the consideration of spatial features, while the time-series incorporation to it will help in temporal analysis.
        </code></pre>
<h2>4 Approach:</h2>
<pre><code>        The project will proceed in several phases:
        **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Collect geospatial data (e.g., county-level maps, housing costs, employment rates) and demographic data (e.g., income levels, population density). Represent data as both tabular datasets (for traditional models) and graph structures (for GNNs). For graphs:Nodes: Counties or regions. Preprocess data to ensure consistency across formats.
        **Modeling Approaches**: Traditional Models: Use regression-based models (linear regression, random forests) as a baseline for predicting trends. Graph Neural Networks: Experiment with suitable GNN architectures such as Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) for static spatial relationships.

<h2>5 Timeline:</h2>
<pre><code>        This is a rough timeline for the project:
         **Weeks 1-2**: Familiarization with project requirements, intellectual humility constructs, and open-source tools.
         **Weeks 3-8**: Design, develop, and build a working POC for 1 region.
         **Weeks 9-12**: Upscaling it for the other regions
         **Weeks 13-16**: Extrapolate the missing regions.
         **Weeks 17-18**: Final reporting, documentation, and presentation of outcomes.
        </code></pre>
<h2>6 Expected Number Students:</h2>
<pre><code>        This project is suitable for a team of 2 student, given the scope and need for interdisciplinary collaboration.
        </code></pre>
<h2>7 Possible Issues:</h2>
<pre><code>        Potential challenges for this project include:
         **Limited Training Data**: Finding appropriate datasets for Spatial analysis may be a limiting factor.
        </code></pre>
