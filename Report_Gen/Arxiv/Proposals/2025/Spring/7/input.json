  "project_name": "Analyze and predict migration trends of low-income families in FEMA Region 9 in response to climate change impacts, focusing on identifying spatial and temporal patterns to inform equitable relocation strategies.",
  "Objective": " \n            The primary goal of this project is to predict trends in low-income populations (e.g., displaced individuals) in Region 9(California, Arizona, Nevada) and identify optimal relocation strategies using geographical data. The problem involves:\n            Modeling spatial and temporal dynamics of low-income groups.\n            Incorporating complex relationships between regions (e.g., migration flows, resource availability).\n\n            ",
  "Dataset": "\n            There are primarily 3 datasets that we are going to work with:\n            1. Health analytics\n            2. Unemployment\n            3. Poverty\n            ",
  "Rationale": "\n            Utilizing GNNs will help in undertaking the consideration of spatial features, while the time-series incorporation to it will help in temporal analysis.\n            ",
  "Approach": "\n            The project will proceed in several phases:\n            **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Collect geospatial data (e.g., county-level maps, housing costs, employment rates) and demographic data (e.g., income levels, population density). Represent data as both tabular datasets (for traditional models) and graph structures (for GNNs). For graphs:Nodes: Counties or regions. Preprocess data to ensure consistency across formats.\n            **Modeling Approaches**: Traditional Models: Use regression-based models (linear regression, random forests) as a baseline for predicting trends. Graph Neural Networks: Experiment with suitable GNN architectures such as Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) for static spatial relationships.\n\n            ",
  "Timeline": "\n            This is a rough timeline for the project:\n             **Weeks 1-2**: Familiarization with project requirements, intellectual humility constructs, and open-source tools.\n             **Weeks 3-8**: Design, develop, and build a working POC for 1 region.\n             **Weeks 9-12**: Upscaling it for the other regions\n             **Weeks 13-16**: Extrapolate the missing regions.\n             **Weeks 17-18**: Final reporting, documentation, and presentation of outcomes.\n            ",
  "Expected Number Students": "\n            This project is suitable for a team of 2 student, given the scope and need for interdisciplinary collaboration.\n            ",
  "Possible Issues": "\n            Potential challenges for this project include:\n             **Limited Training Data**: Finding appropriate datasets for Spatial analysis may be a limiting factor.\n            ",
